 * Note: If the GCDAsyncSocket instance is deallocated while it is still connected,
 * and the delegate is not also deallocated, then this method will be invoked,
 * but the sock parameter will be nil. (It must necessarily be nil since it is no longer available.)
 * This is a generally rare, but is possible if one writes code like this:
 *
 * asyncSocket = nil; // I'm implicitly disconnecting the socket
 *
 * In this case it may preferrable to nil the delegate beforehand, like this:
 *
 * asyncSocket.delegate = nil; // Don't invoke my delegate method
 * asyncSocket = nil; // I'm implicitly disconnecting the socket
 *
 * Of course, this depends on how your state machine is configured.
